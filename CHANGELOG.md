    updated the requirements.txt because I wanna code on my laptop for a little while

Date:   Fri Apr 28 19:23:32 2023 -0600

    Got resumes to be able to be viewed but the api they library is using is no longer around so I'll need to change it, set up the ability to search keywords on the backend but haven't quite got it done on the frontend so I will need to work more on it in a little bit

Date:   Fri Apr 28 20:33:09 2023 -0600

    got the search function to work, it's pretty cool

Date:   Fri Apr 28 21:01:06 2023 -0600

    got it to not error out when you search something that doesn't exist

Date:   Fri Apr 28 22:30:45 2023 -0600

    Now you can actually see the resume but txt files can no longer be accepted as proper files. I will work on the comment and rating part 
later and hopefully be able to start styling and deploying
